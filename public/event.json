Jenny studied at Adelaide University, then obtained a PhD in Molecular Biology at the University of California (Berkeley) in 1971. She lectured at La Trobe University, then at ANU she founded and directed the Comparative Genomics Group and an ARC Centre of Excellence. She returned to La Trobe in 2011 as Distinguished Professor and Vice Chancellor’s Fellow. Jenny has produced three books and more than 400 research articles. She has many honours and awards, including the Academy’s Macfarlane Burnet medal (2006) and an Order of Australia (2010). She is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, and served on the Executive for 8 years as Foreign Secretary, then as Education Secretary.
